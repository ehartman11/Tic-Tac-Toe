# Tic-Tac-Toe
This produces a generic tic-tac-toe game with an AI that uses a look up table to determine the best option to play against the user. 
It is not yet a smart AI that learns to recognize the best options by anticipating an opponents next move but that is the next step I will be working on. 
More often that not games will end in a tie, unless you figure out the way to beat the logic. 
I have included many DocStrings and comments that hopefully explain in sufficient detail the structure and inner workings of the setup and logic. 
Please reach out with any recommendations. This is a simple personal project to practice good programming techniques and dip in to ML and AI. 
Otherwise, Enjoy the game!
